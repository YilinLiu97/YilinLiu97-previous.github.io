Fg.1 The network consists of 10 successive convolutional layers with kernel size 3x3x3 and a fully convolutional layer replaced by a large set of 1x1x1 convolutions. The number of neurons on the classification layer could be either 3 or 11 (denotes the number of classes, including the background), depending on the task.
